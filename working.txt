find min distance

dist[] 
dist[i] is min dist of i from root node


normal bfs will result in incorrect as

			1
		/		\
	 2 	-	 3
	/ 	    \





d[4] = min( w[1][4]+ d[1] , w[3][4] + d[3] )

this works for all the weights not just 0-1 weight paradigm


ek assumption  le sakte hai min path ko leke 
if d[i] = 0 then mark that node as visited
